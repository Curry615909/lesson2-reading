<p><b>文本精读</b></p>
<p>An old man and a boy travelled along this runway. They moved slowly, for the old man was very old, his movements tremulous, and he leaned heavily upon his staff. A <mark>rude</mark> skull-cap of goat-skin protected his head from the sun. From beneath this fell a scant fringe of stained and dirty-white hair. A <mark>visor</mark>, <mark>ingeniously</mark> made from a large leaf, shielded his eyes, and from under this he peered at the way of his feet on the trail. His beard, which should have been snow-white but which showed the same weather-wear and camp-stain as his hair, fell nearly to his waist in a great tangled mass. About his chest and shoulders hung a single, mangy <mark>garment</mark> of goat-skin. His arms and legs, withered and skinny, betokened extreme age, as well as did their sunburn and scars and scratches betoken long years of exposure to the elements. 这段描述了这个老人的外貌和特征</p>
<br>
<p>The boy, who led the way, checking the eagerness of his muscles to the slow progress of the elder, likewise wore a single garment—a ragged-edged piece of bear-skin, with a hole in the middle through which he had thrust his head. He could not have been more than twelve years old. Tucked coquettishly over one ear was the freshly severed tail of a pig. In one hand he carried a medium-sized bow and an arrow. 这段描述了这个小孩的特征和外貌</p>
<br>
<p>On his back was a quiverful of arrows. From a <mark>sheath</mark> hanging about his neck on a thong, projected the battered handle of a hunting knife. He was as brown as a berry, and walked softly, with almost a catlike <mark>tread</mark>. In marked contrast with his sunburned skin were his eyes—blue, deep blue, but keen and sharp as a pair of gimlets. They seemed to bore into aft about him in a way that was <mark>habitual</mark>. <u>As he went along he smelled things, as well, his <mark>distended</mark>, quivering nostrils carrying to his brain an endless series of messages from the outside world.嗅觉灵敏</u> <u>Also, his hearing was acute, and had been so trained that it operated automatically.经过训练的</u> Without conscious effort, he heard all the slight sounds in the apparent quiet—heard, and differentiated, and classified these sounds—whether they were of the wind rustling the leaves, of the humming of bees and gnats, of the distant rumble of the sea that drifted to him only in lulls, or of the gopher, just under his foot, shoving a pouchful of earth into the entrance of his hole. </p>
<br>
<p>Suddenly he became alertly tense. Sound, sight, and odor had given him a simultaneous warning. His hand went back to the old man, touching him, and the pair stood still. Ahead, at one side of the top of the <mark>embankment</mark>, arose a crackling sound, and the boy’s gaze was fixed on the tops of the agitated bushes. Then a large bear, a grizzly, crashed into view, and likewise stopped abruptly, at sight of the humans. He did not like them, and growled <mark>querulously</mark>. Slowly the boy fitted the arrow to the bow, and slowly he pulled the bowstring taut. But he never removed his eyes from the bear. </p>
<br>
<p>The old man peered from under his green leaf at the danger, and stood as quietly as the boy. For a few seconds this mutual <mark>scrutinizing</mark> went on; then, the bear betraying a growing irritability, the boy, with a movement of his head, indicated that the old man must step aside from the trail and go down the embankment. The boy followed, going backward, still holding the bow taut and ready. They waited till a crashing among the bushes from the opposite side of the embankment told them the bear had gone on. The boy grinned as he led back to the trail. </p>
<br>
<p>“A big un, Granser,” he chuckled.</p>
<br>
<p>The old man shook his head.</p>
<br>
<p>“They get thicker every day,” he complained in a thin, undependable falsetto. “Who’d have thought I’d live to see the time when a man would be afraid of his life on the way to the Cliff House. When I was a boy, Edwin, men and women and little babies used to come out here from San Francisco by tens of thousands on a nice day. And there weren’t any bears then. <u>No, sir. They used to pay money to look at them in cages, they were that rare.”以前很稀有</u> </p>
<br>
<p>“What is money, Granser?” </p>
<br>
<p>Before the old man could answer, the boy recollected and triumphantly shoved his hand into a pouch under his bear-skin and pulled forth a battered and tarnished silver dollar. The old man’s eyes glistened, as he held the coin close to them. </p>
<br>
<p>“I can’t see,” he muttered. “You look and see if you can make out the date, Edwin.” </p>
<br>
<p>The boy laughed. </p>
<br>
<p>“You’re a great Granser,” he cried delightedly, “always making believe them little marks mean something.” </p>
